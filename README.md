# Comprehensive Statusline for Claude Code

Feature-rich statusline with model, directory, git, session cost, thinking mode, and current mode.

```
Sonnet 4.5 â”‚ ~/projects â”‚ main âœ“ â”‚ $0.45/$15 â”‚ ðŸ§  ON (â‡¥ Tab) â”‚ ðŸ“‹ PLAN (â‡§â‡¥)
```

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install anuragthakur77/claude-comprehensive-statusline
```

That's it! The statusline activates automatically after installation.

## Features

- Session cost tracking vs budget (color-coded: $0.45/$15)
- Git branch with clean/dirty status
- Thinking mode toggle (â‡¥ Tab)
- Current mode with switch shortcut (â‡§â‡¥)
- Smart directory paths with ~ shorthand

## Note

Built-in mode indicator still appears. We've filed [issue #10406](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10406) to make it toggleable.
